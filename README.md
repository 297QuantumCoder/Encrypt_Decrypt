# Secure File Encryption/Decryption Tool

This project implements a simple GUI-based Secure File Encryption/Decryption Tool using Python and Tkinter. The tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt files using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm provided by the cryptography library.

## Features

- **File Selection:** Users can select a file using a file dialog.
- **Encryption:** Selected files can be encrypted using a randomly generated encryption key.
- **Decryption:** Encrypted files can be decrypted by providing the encryption key.
- **Encryption Key Handling:** The generated encryption key is copied to the clipboard for easy access.
- **Error Handling:** Proper error messages are displayed if encryption or decryption fails.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/297QuantumCoder/Encrypt_Decrypt.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Encrypt_Decrypt
   ```
